Custom HTML/CSS with WCAG compliance (AA)

This presentation of videos with a unique splash page ended up being a lot of fun to make after some unique challenges. The requirement of AA level WCAG compliance was only introduced well into the development phase. The testing process for the splash page animation was especially involved since the rotating content had to be navigable using the tab keyboard key as well as a specialized audio screen reader. 

The animation Jquery was also a fun learning experience so be sure to take a look at main.js line 316 :)
