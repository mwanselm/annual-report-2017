		<p class="body">Before he joined Guardian’s internship program in 2015, Braidy Kivelier was a motivated student who studied computer information systems in community college. When he signed on as an intern, his work focused on assisting case managers in the processing of claims, and he excelled at learning new programs, building on his college experience. As his internship came to an end, he knew he wasn’t ready to leave Guardian.</p>

		<p class="body">Braidy took the initiative to speak with his manager about the possibility of a full-time position. As luck would have it, an opening was available, and Braidy interviewed with his manager. Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a claims assistant.</p>

		
		<div class="pull-quote" id="pull-quote-2">
			<p class="quote"><span>It’s like a family.</span> <span>I get up</span> <span>every morning and</span> <span>can’t wait to </span> <span>go to work.”</span></p>
			<p class="quote-sig"><span>Braidy Kivelier</span></p>
		</div>
		<p class="body">Braidy again excelled in his new position as a claims assistant, and he was soon ready to grow into yet another role within the Company. He continued to show initiative, shadowing a disability claims case manager to learn the nuances of the job, and soon enough he became a claims case manager himself.</p>

		<p class="body">The personal experiences Braidy brings to his role make him a compassionate and trustworthy ally for his customers. &quot;I try to imagine myself in their position. I have a disability, too, and I treat them the way I would like to be treated.&quot; As Braidy continues to acquire new skills and advance professionally, he envisions a long career at Guardian. &quot;They give you the opportunity to grow, and I’ve seen that with my own eyes.&quot;</p>

		<p class="body">Braidy’s professional growth has brought with it personal growth as well. He’s more independent now. Since working at Guardian, he has been able to save for and purchase a car that is being adapted with hand controls.</p>

		<p class="body">Braidy’s internship gave him the skills and work experience he needed, not only to start a career but to build one. When he was ready to take on new challenges, Guardian helped him find a role that would be a solid fit. Why? It goes back to living a Guardian core value: People Count.</p>
